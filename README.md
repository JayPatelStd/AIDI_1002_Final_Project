## **Problem Description:**

The project, “Financial-Data-Time-Series-Forecasting-Using-Neural-Networks”, is focused on predicting future financial data based on historical time series data using neural networks. The associated paper is currently in press at IEEE ICONAT 2022.

The problem involves forecasting financial data, a task that has significant implications for decision-making processes in the financial sector. By using neural networks, the project aims to identify complex patterns and relationships in the data, which can then be used to predict future financial trends.

## **Limitations About Other Approaches:**

Traditional methods of financial forecasting, such as statistical and econometric models, often rely on assumptions that may not hold in real-world scenarios, such as linearity and stationarity of time series data. These models may also struggle to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.

Machine learning approaches, while powerful, also have their limitations. They often require large amounts of data to perform well and can be prone to overfitting. Furthermore, they can act as “black boxes”, making it difficult to interpret their predictions and understand the underlying relationships in the data.

The use of neural networks in this project aims to address some of these limitations by leveraging their ability to model complex, non-linear relationships and their capacity for handling large datasets. However, it’s important to note that while neural networks can improve prediction accuracy, they also require careful tuning and validation to ensure robust performance. Additionally, interpretability remains a challenge with these models.
